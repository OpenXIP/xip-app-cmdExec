Welcome to the XIP&trade; Command Execution Application Project!
================================================================

The [eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) is an
Open Source project that provides a framework for developing image processing and
visualization applications.  While XIP's emphasis is medical applications, it can be 
used for other types of applications.

This repository holds a
[DICOM Hosted Application](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf)
built from the XIP Skeleton Application](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-host)
that simple executes a shell or DOS command, passing to the command the names
of the files holding the data being provided by the
[DICOM Hosting System](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf).  

The ultimate goals of the project include:

* Provide a really simple example of a complete XIP-based application.
* Provide a means to launch any program that can be started from a
  command line prompt as a
  [DICOM Hosted Application](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf).
